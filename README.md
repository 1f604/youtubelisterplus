I created this repo because I wanted to extend youtubelister with some additional features such as the ability to save playlists on local user machine in various formats:

- song name only format. This will be a list consisting of only song names. The playlist will be generated by searching youtube for each of those names. 
- video ID | song name format. The video id will be loaded if it can be loaded (e.g not deleted, allows embedding, not blocked in your country etc) otherwise search for new video to play.
